This is intended to be a simple example program to demonstrate how to
do event-driven programming in Mojolicious.

I will use a test-driven development (TDD) approach so that each
development cycle is small and consists of:

* writing a single new test that's designed to fail
* implementing code to pass that test

I'll make a git commit after each of those steps, so you can use the
git commit history to see how functionality was added step by step.

Many users won't ever need to dive into the event-driven aspects of
Mojolicious programming, but if you do ever find yourself asking "I
wonder if I could do this task asynchronously?", then I hope that this
example program can be a useful guide to help you find a solution.
